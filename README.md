# UCD-Deep Reinforcement-Learning-Journal-Club
The formation of DRL Journal Club is to foster interest and engender discussions on Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep RL,  and Machine Learning topics. The club was founded by members of UC Davis Cyber Human Physical Systems (CHPS). Members of the journal club are expected to meet weekly, keep up with reading materials and actively engaged during discussions. Material discussed during weekly meetings is maily from the book by R. Sutton "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction."

Implemetation code of some of the book's chapters (in MATLAB and Python) are also provided in this repo.
